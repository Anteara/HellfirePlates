#Welcome to HellfirePlates.

HellfirePlates is a *fork* of **ShaguPlates**. Shagu is the author of ShaguPlates, and thus credit for the original addon goes to him. All I did was port it to TBC, and add some extra functionalities.
If you want to thank anyone for development of this addon, please thank Shagu.





Note: If you have ShadowedUnitFrames, and you /reload in combat, and your unit frames dissappear, that's not a problem with this addon (Tested without HellfirePlates enabled), it's a problem with ShadowedUnitFrames... add an underscore to the folder name, and it will work correctly. This will cause Shadowed Unit Frames to be loaded first, and thus not produce these errors.
